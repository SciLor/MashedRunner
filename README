ReadMe

You will need the .NET Framework 2.0
http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=19

SciLor's Mashed Runner allows you to run Mashed Fully Loaded and Mashed ;).

It bypasses the launcher of the game, so you can run the game without installation and any cd.
This way you may just copy the game onto an usb-stick and play it anywhere.

Additionally you can select the game's language, disable the intros and create a shortcut on your desktop for this launcher
with the click of a button.

ToDo:

Additional:
This is no crack, nocd or how you want to call it. The game implements the copy protection in the launcher (launch.exe),
but the game is in the "MFL.exe"/"MASHED.exe". The launcher runs the "MFL.exe"/"MASHED.exe" with different command line parameters,
that define the language and if it should show the settings.
If you run the "MFL.exe" directly the game will run in english and prompt for video/control settings on every statup.

This application replaces the launcher and runs the "MFL.exe"/"MASHED.exe" with the fitting parameters.
